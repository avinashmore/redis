Unlike other key-value stores where both key and value are of string type, redis supports more data type/structures. 
what are other key value stores?

Which other data types does redis support? 

Binary-safe strings: 
Lists: basically linked lists.
Sets: collections of unique, unsorted string elements.
Sorted sets: Each string has a floating point score. Strings are sorted by this score. Useful to get range of values.

Hashes, which are maps composed of fields associated with values. Both the field and the value are strings. This is very similar to Ruby or Python hashes.
Bit arrays (or simply bitmaps): it is possible, using special commands, to handle String values like an array of bits: you can set and clear individual bits, count all the bits set to 1, find the first set or unset bit, and so forth.
HyperLogLogs: this is a probabilistic data structure which is used in order to estimate the cardinality of a set. Don't be scared, it is simpler than it seems... See later in the HyperLogLog section of this tutorial.
