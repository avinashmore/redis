Unlike other key-value stores where both key and value are of string type, redis supports more data type/structures. 
what are other key value stores?

Which other data types does redis support? 

Binary-safe strings: 
Lists: basically linked lists.
Sets: collections of unique, unsorted string elements.
Sorted sets: Each string has a floating point score. Strings are sorted by this score. Useful to get range of values like top 10 or bottom 10.
Hashes: similar to Ruby or Python hashes.
Bit arrays: I haven't understood those yet
HyperLogLogs: I haven't understood those yet.
